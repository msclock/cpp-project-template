# Security

The section covers the concerning of security and the measures taken within the C++ project.

> C++ is a risky language because of its low-level nature and its ability to access and manipulate memory directly. It is important to understand the security implications of using C++ and to take appropriate measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities.

Here are some of the points to consider:

- Best secure coding practices.
- Warnings detectors.
- Protection mechanisms from OS.
- Use latest compiler and OS updates.
- Protection tests.

## Best Secure Coding Practices

For developers, there are several best secure coding practices that can be followed while developing C++ applications. These include:

- [ISO CPP Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)
- [SEI CERT C++ Coding Standard](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/seccode/SEI+CERT+Coding+Standards)

These guidelines cover various aspects of C++ programming, such as memory management, resource management, input validation, and error handling. Best of luck with implementing secure coding practices!

## Warnings Detectors

Modern, security-aware C and C++ secure coding practices aim to proactively avoid introducing vulnerabilities into software. However, in practice, it is difficult to write secure code perfectly from scratch. Therefore, it is essential to use warning detectors to identify potential vulnerabilities in the development process from analysis tools, compilers and OS to make the appropriate decisions.

Here we have provided some of the warning detectors include Compiler Warnings Options, Static Analysis Tools, and Dynamic Analysis Tools. See
the topic on [Warnings](../topics/warnings.md) to learn how to use these tools effectively.

## Protection Mechanisms from OS

In realities, it is not possible to completely eliminate all vulnerabilities in the developers's hands. Therefore, it is important to use OS-level protection mechanisms to protect against potential vulnerabilities from the outside.

This mechanism requires the applications to be prepared at build time enabling specific option flags from the compiler or linker. These options can be used to enable security features from the OS, such as stack protection, data execution prevention, and address space layout randomization. See the topic on [Hardening](../topics/hardening.md) to learn more about these mechanisms.

## Use Latest Compiler and OS Updates

It is essential to use the latest compiler and OS updates to ensure that the application is secure. These updates can include security patches, bug fixes, and enhancements.

- Latest [compiler](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support) from vendor support.

## Protection Tests

In addition to the above security measures, it is essential to conduct regular security tests to ensure that the application is secure. These tests can include penetration testing, fuzz testing, and security code reviews.
