# Tutorials

This section provides a brief introduction to the tutorials.The following pages will cover the main all necessary topics for using the scaffold to ease a complete C++ development process. From the initial phases of **project initiation and quick validation**, to maintenance phase of the **code quality** and **testing** processes, to **packaging** the software, the tutorials provide a step-by-step guide to help developers get started with the scaffold. We aim to provide a comprehensive and practical guide for modern C++ developers on open-source platforms like GitHub and GitLab, from novice to expert, who want to build reliable and maintainable software.

Best practices can vary based on specific circumstances. We are open to comments and suggestions to refine the approach.
